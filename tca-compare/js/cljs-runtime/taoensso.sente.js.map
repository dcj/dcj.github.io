We lean on core.async's\n      efficiency here.\n    * For WebSocket fallback we use long-polling rather than HTTP 1.1 streaming\n      (chunked transfer encoding). Http-kit _does_ support chunked transfer\n      encoding but a small minority of browsers &/or proxies do not. Instead of\n      implementing all 3 modes (WebSockets, streaming, long-polling) - it seemed\n      reasonable to focus on the two extremes (performance + compatibility).\n      In any case client support for WebSockets is growing rapidly so fallback\n      modes will become increasingly irrelevant while the extra simplicity will\n      continue to pay dividends.\n\n  General-use notes:\n    * Single HTTP req+session persists over entire chsk session but cannot\n      modify sessions! Use standard a/sync HTTP Ring req/resp for logins, etc.\n    * Easy to wrap standard HTTP Ring resps for transport over chsks. Prefer\n      this approach to modifying handlers (better portability).\n\n  [4] Used to be a csrf-token. Was removed in v1.14 for security reasons.\n  A `nil` remains for semi-backwards-compatibility with pre-v1.14 clients.\"\n\n  {:author \"Peter Taoussanis (@ptaoussanis)\"}\n\n  #?(:clj\n     (:require\n      [clojure.string :as str]\n      [clojure.core.async :as async :refer (<! <!! >! >!! put! chan go go-loop)]\n      [taoensso.encore :as enc :refer (swap-in! reset-in! swapped have have! have?)]\n      [taoensso.timbre :as timbre :refer (tracef debugf infof warnf errorf)]\n      [taoensso.sente.interfaces :as interfaces]))\n\n  #?(:cljs\n     (:require\n      [clojure.string :as str]\n      [cljs.core.async :as async :refer (<! >! put! chan)]\n      [taoensso.encore :as enc :refer (format swap-in! reset-in! swapped)\n       :refer-macros (have have! have?)]\n      [taoensso.timbre :as timbre :refer-macros (tracef debugf infof warnf errorf)]\n      [taoensso.sente.interfaces :as interfaces]))\n\n  #?(:cljs\n     (:require-macros\n      [cljs.core.async.macros :as asyncm :refer (go go-loop)]\n      [taoensso.sente :as sente-macros :refer (elide-require)])))\n\n(if (vector? taoensso.encore/encore-version)\n  (enc/assert-min-encore-version [2 105 0])\n  (enc/assert-min-encore-version  2.105))\n\n(def sente-version \"Useful for identifying client/server mismatch\"\n  [1 11 0])\n\n#?(:cljs (def ^:private node-target?
